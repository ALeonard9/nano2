This set of code is used to create tables in a database called tournament in PSQL. This uses Python classes to test and check sql functionality.

Navigate to the tournament directory:
"cd /vagrant/tournament"

To run tests, simply create a psql database via;
"create database tournament"

After entering psql (type "psql"), import the database.
"\i tournament.sql"

Then run;
"python tournament_test.py"

All tests should pass.
